# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Diego MartÃ­nez SÃ¡nchez and I like to program, IÂ´m still on my search of a job in which I can be able to keep improving my programming skills.
## About the languages I know are the next ones ordered from the one with the most experience I have to the one with the least experience but not limited just for these ones. In mi CV uploaded to my linkedIn profile there is more decription:
* Python
* C
* Javascript
* Bash
* HTML, CSS
* Kotlin

## Frameworks
* Django
* Flask
<br>
In this case IÂ´m describing just this because in this github I will upload what I have developed or what IÂ´m still developing.

## About me
I really would like to learn more about software and not just limited to what I already described here or done in this github. IÂ´m a junior developer at JPMorgan Chase and I hope I can develop software much of my life.
